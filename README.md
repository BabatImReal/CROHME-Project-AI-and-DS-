# CROHME-Project-AI-and-DS

Online Handwritten Mathematical Expression Dataset 
This is a project guided by Mr. Nguyen Tuan Cuong of Vietnamese-German University. The project is aimed to calculate online handwritten from Mathematical Expression Dataset. In the CROHME Training notebook, we build our vocabulary class, dataset, dataloader, applying Pytorch lightning module, Loss CTC and we train and test to bring out the smallest train loss and val loss in order to bring out the highest accuracy for our project.
